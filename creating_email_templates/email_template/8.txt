Hi Sage Wieser, 
I would like to use the studio version, but I can not exchange the preview images, even though they were deleted in the online organizer - i. E. I have changed the order of the products or deleted products so that the preview always shows the first product, but nothing happens.Reach out me at (541) 754-3010 
Thanks, 
Rob Willison
