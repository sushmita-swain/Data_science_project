Hi Josephine Darakjy, 
On Saturday the version WAREHOUSE Sales firstclass 20 Neo got, after installation it had to be found, that the label of the buttons in the export screen are not readable (eg file format, navigation, compression, font, sorting, etc. the complete caption under File options, Design title page and Design buttons. 
Thanks,
